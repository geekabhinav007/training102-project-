# training102-project

As per the study scheme of B.Tech Information Technology (2018 Scheme), each student should undergo four weeks trainings [Training –II (TR-102) at the end of 4th Semester and Training –III (TR103) at the end of 6th Semester].
Each student is required to submit the individual training report at the end of each training. The
primary aim of the training report is to train the student to write a professional and comprehensive
report. This should exhibit capability to present specific information and to develop overall
communication skills of a student. The essence of the report is to describe the work/project a student
has undertaken during his training/internship, learned tools and techniques, contributions made to the
work environment and the conclusions drawn from the student’s experience.
